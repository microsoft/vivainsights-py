    "# Demo: Habit Formation and Usage Segmentation Analysis with vivainsights\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to analyze **habit formation** and **usage segmentation** using the **vivainsights** Python package. These analyses are particularly powerful for understanding technology adoption patterns, especially for new tools like **Microsoft Copilot** and other digital collaboration technologies.\n",

    "- Identify early adopters vs. late adopters\n",
    "- Monitor the progression from trial to habitual use\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Organizational Insights:**\n",
    "- Understand which groups form productive habits faster\n",
    "- Identify training and support needs\n",
    "- Measure the success of change management initiatives\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **Strategic Decision Making:**\n",
    "- Optimize rollout strategies for new technologies\n",

    "   - Compare different time window approaches (4-week vs 12-week)\n",
    "   - Create custom segmentation parameters for specific technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Technology Adoption Case Studies**\n",
    "   - Analyze Copilot adoption patterns\n",
    "   - Compare adoption across different applications (Teams, Outlook, Excel, etc.)\n",
    "   - Track progression from initial usage to habitual behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Parameter Tuning**\n",
    "   - Customize thresholds for different technologies\n",
    "   - Optimize time windows for your analysis needs\n",
    "   - Handle edge cases and data quality considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functions Covered\n",
